            <p>Top-down learning is a teaching style that focuses on providing students a large view of a subject, without explaining the components that make up the subject. It is based on the idea that a teacher drives the classroom and determines what is to be taught. Top-down learning also involves perceiving the world by drawing from what we already know in order to interpret new information. Top-down learning is influenced by higher mental processes such as expectations, beliefs, values, and social influences.</p>

            @include('components.bottomup')
            <p>Bottom-up learning is a teaching style that focuses on providing students the components that make up a subject, and then building up to a larger view of the subject. It is based on the idea that students are active learners who construct their own knowledge from the bottom up. Bottom-up learning also involves perceiving the world by processing sensory information and building up to higher levels of cognition. Bottom-up learning is influenced by lower mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, and reasoning.</p>
