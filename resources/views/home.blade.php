            <p>Top-down learning is a teaching style that focuses on providing students a large view of a subject, without
                explaining the components that make up the subject. It is based on the idea that a teacher drives the
                classroom and determines what is to be taught. Top-down learning also involves perceiving the world by
                drawing from what we already know in order to interpret new information. Top-down learning is influenced by
                higher mental processes such as expectations, beliefs, values, and social influences.</p>

            @include('components.bottomup')
            <p>Bottom-up learning is a teaching style that focuses on providing students the components that make up a
                subject, and then building up to a larger view of the subject. It is based on the idea that students are
                active learners who construct their own knowledge from the bottom up. Bottom-up learning also involves
                perceiving the world by processing sensory information and building up to higher levels of cognition.
                Bottom-up learning is influenced by lower mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, and
                reasoning.</p>
